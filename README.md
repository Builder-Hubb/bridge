# Welcome to Bridge ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

When you're ready, run:
1. `npm install` to clone the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-task`
3. Work on your feature inside `/screens`, `/components`, or `/styles`
4. Commit and push: `git push origin feature/your-task`
5. Open a pull request and tag `@BenedictaUche`

### Code Style
- Follow the `Colours.ts` file for color values
- Keep components modular and reusable
